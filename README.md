Implementation of various tree and heaps (to do) structures. Only binary search tree, AVL tree, splay tree are supported now. Available operations includes `search`, `insert!`, `topdowninsert!`, `delete!`, `topdowndelete!`, `splay!`, `topdownsplay!`, `findmin`, `findmax`. Outputs are formatted through `AbstractTrees.jl`. Other structures and plotting recipe are under developments!

## TO DO
1.  Red-black tree
2.  2-4 tree
3.  AA tree
4.  2-3 tree
5.  Heaps
6.  Plotting recipe
